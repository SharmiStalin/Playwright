// Assignment Details:
// Create a JavaScript program that defines a function to compute the intersection of two arrays. The 
// intersection should include elements that appear in both arrays without any duplicates.
// Assignment Requirements:
// 1. Write a function named `intersection` that accepts two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`, which are 
// arrays of numbers, and returns an array of their intersection.
// 2. Ensure no duplicate elements in the resulting array. If an element appears in both `arr1` and 
// `arr2`, it should appear only once in the result.
// 3. Use a loop to find common elements. Iterate through each element of `arr1` and check if it is 
// present in `arr2` and not already included in the result array.
// 4. Include example calls to the `intersection` function with different arrays to demonstrate the 
// functionâ€™s functionality. Include examples with no common elements, all elements common, and 
// typical cases.

function findintersection(arr1,arr2){
let intersection = [];
for(let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++){
for(let j=0;j<arr2.length;j++){
    if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]){
        intersection.push(arr1[i]);
    }
}
}
const uniqueArray = [...new Set(intersection)];
console.log(uniqueArray); 
}

findintersection([1,2,4,5,7,9,4],[2,5,8,9,4]);
